# Customer Churn Analysis – Telecom Industry

## 📌 Objective
Predict customer churn and derive actionable strategies to retain users in a highly competitive telecom environment.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, ELI5)
- Power BI (for interactive dashboards and storytelling)

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing in Python**
   - Cleaned the data (handled missing values, outliers)
   - Created new features like churn probability and customer segment

2. **Churn Prediction Model**
   - Built a binary classification model using Scikit-learn
   - Explained model predictions using ELI5

3. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Customers were segmented into: At Risk, Loyal, Dormant

4. **Dashboarding in Power BI**
   - Visualized KPIs (Total Customers, Churn Rate, Avg Spend)
   - Included charts: Donut (Churn), Bar (Segment), Scatter, Line
   - Exported visuals to PDF and PowerPoint reports

## 📈 Deliverables
- Python ML Notebook
- Power BI Dashboard
- PDF and PowerPoint Report
- Final Recommendations

## ✅ Final Recommendations

• Encourage customers to switch from month-to-month to one-year contracts to reduce churn.  
• Customers paying with electronic checks have a higher churn rate. Promote auto-payment options such as credit card or bank transfer.  
• Focus on high-spend customers in the 'At Risk' segment with personalized offers to retain revenue.  
• Improving technical support access can help retain customers who rely on bundled internet services.  
• Provide upsell opportunities to loyal, long-tenure customers to boost ARPU (Average Revenue Per User).
